# Full GPT-2 Transformer Training for CartPole Control

This setup provides a complete, production-ready training pipeline for a GPT-2 transformer model designed for CartPole control inference.

## Overview

The configuration has been optimized for a **full training run** with the following key improvements:

### Model Architecture
- **Embedding dimension**: 512 (increased from 256)
- **Layers**: 16 (increased from 8)
- **Attention heads**: 16 (increased from 8)
- **Context length**: 1024 tokens
- **Total parameters**: ~85M parameters

### Training Configuration
- **Training steps**: 10,000,000 (increased from 1,000,000)
- **Epochs**: 1000 (increased from 125)
- **Batch size**: 16 (optimized for memory efficiency)
- **Learning rate**: 0.0001 (conservative for stability)
- **Curriculum learning**: Enabled with gradual progression

### Production Features
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular checkpointing (every 250 steps)
- Weights & Biases integration
- Error handling and recovery
- Model validation and testing

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate Training Data

If you haven't already, generate the CartPole training dataset:

```bash
python generate_cartpole_data.py
```

This will create 100 pickle files with CartPole trajectories in the `dataset_cartpole_aidan/` folder.

### 3. Run Full Training

Execute the full training pipeline:

```bash
python run_full_training.py --config conf/cartpole_aidan.yaml
```

The script will:
- Validate CUDA availability and setup
- Check for training data
- Initialize the large GPT-2 model (~85M parameters)
- Start training with comprehensive logging
- Save checkpoints regularly
- Monitor training progress via Weights & Biases

### 4. Monitor Training

Training progress is logged to:
- **Console output**: Real-time loss and metrics
- **Weights & Biases**: Online dashboard with detailed metrics
- **Local files**: Text logs in the output directory

Expected training time: **Several hours to days** depending on your hardware.

### 5. Test Trained Model

After training, test the model's inference capabilities:

```bash
python test_trained_model.py --config conf/cartpole_aidan.yaml
```

This will:
- Load the latest checkpoint
- Run inference on sample trajectories
- Generate comparison plots
- Calculate performance metrics

## Configuration Details

### Model Configuration (`conf/cartpole_aidan.yaml`)

```yaml
model:
  family: "gpt2"
  n_positions: 1024    # Maximum trajectory length
  n_dims: 4           # State dimension [x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]
  n_embd: 512         # Large embedding dimension
  n_layer: 16         # Deep network for complex patterns
  n_head: 16          # Multi-head attention

training:
  epochs: 1000        # Extended training
  batch_size: 16      # Memory-efficient batch size
  learning_rate: 0.0001  # Conservative learning rate
  train_steps: 10000000  # Full convergence
```

### Why This Is a Full Training Run

**Previous configuration issues:**
- Small model (8 layers, 256 embedding) - insufficient capacity
- Limited training steps (1M) - insufficient for convergence
- Large batch size (64) - memory inefficient for large models
- High learning rate (0.001) - unstable for large models

**Current full training setup:**
- Large model (16 layers, 512 embedding) - sufficient capacity for complex control
- Extended training (10M steps) - ensures full convergence
- Optimized batch size (16) - balances memory and training efficiency
- Conservative learning rate (0.0001) - stable training for large models
- Proper curriculum learning - gradual task complexity increase
- Production monitoring - comprehensive logging and checkpointing

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **GPU**: 8GB VRAM (RTX 3070, RTX 4060 Ti, or better)
- **RAM**: 16GB system RAM
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for checkpoints and logs

### Recommended Requirements
- **GPU**: 12GB+ VRAM (RTX 3080, RTX 4070 Ti, or better)
- **RAM**: 32GB system RAM
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space for extended training

### Training Time Estimates
- **RTX 3080**: ~2-3 days for full training
- **RTX 4080**: ~1-2 days for full training
- **RTX 4090**: ~12-24 hours for full training

## Output Files

Training produces the following outputs:

```
output/cartpole_aidan/
├── checkpoint_250.pt      # Regular checkpoints
├── checkpoint_500.pt
├── checkpoint_1000.pt     # Permanent checkpoints
├── ...
├── state.pt              # Latest training state
├── model_training_log.txt # Training logs
└── config.yaml           # Training configuration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce batch size in config (try 8 or 4)
   - Reduce model size (n_embd: 256, n_layer: 12)

2. **Training Too Slow**
   - Ensure CUDA is available and being used
   - Check GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`
   - Consider reducing dataset size for testing

3. **Loss Not Decreasing**
   - Training may need more time (this is a large model)
   - Check learning rate (try 0.00005 for more conservative training)
   - Verify dataset quality

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Mixed Precision** (if supported):
   ```python
   # Add to training script
   from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
   ```

2. **Gradient Accumulation** (for larger effective batch size):
   ```python
   # Modify training loop to accumulate gradients
   ```

3. **Data Loading Optimization**:
   - Use multiple workers for data loading
   - Consider SSD storage for dataset files

## Model Capabilities

After full training, the model should be capable of:

1. **State Prediction**: Accurately predicting next CartPole states
2. **Control Generation**: Generating appropriate control forces
3. **Mode Switching**: Deciding between swing-up and stabilization controllers
4. **Long-term Planning**: Handling sequences up to 1024 time steps
5. **Generalization**: Working on unseen initial conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluation**: Run comprehensive evaluation on test set
2. **Deployment**: Export model for real-time control applications
3. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt model for specific CartPole configurations
4. **Analysis**: Study attention patterns and learned representations

## Code Writing Standards

# Code Writing Standards (MANDATORY)

You MUST write code according to these 10x engineer standards:

1. **Write the minimum necessary code** to solve the problem completely.
2. **Eliminate all unnecessary abstractions** - no premature generalization.
3. **Use language idioms and built-in features** instead of reinventing solutions.
4. **Handle edge cases concisely** without defensive programming bloat.
5. **Name variables and functions precisely** to make code self-documenting.
6. **Solve the exact problem stated** - do not add features for hypothetical future needs.
7. **Optimize for maintainability first**, then performance where actually needed.
8. **Respect simplicity** - never use complex patterns when simpler ones suffice.
9. **Provide only essential comments** - good code largely explains itself.
10. **Deliver production-ready solutions** that work correctly the first time.

VIOLATION OF THESE STANDARDS IS UNACCEPTABLE. As a senior developer, your code must demonstrate expertise through elegance and efficiency, not complexity.
